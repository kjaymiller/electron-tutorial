#Hi Wheelies!!

This is the repo for the Electron Tutorial presented July 13 2017.

Download the repo and run the App in the folder `wealljs-electron-tutorial-darwin-x64`

## For Windows Users

While I did do some development on this app from a PC I was not able to extract a windows copy (yet). 

You can still download the repo and run

`electron .` or `npm start`
